Summary:

This is a little local Tic Tac Toe Game. It's programmed with Visual Studio Community 2015.
To run the WPF you need Windows as OS.

Reason:

This project was a task for my programming class.
Despite it has been done with another Contributor, she isn't working on this project anymore at the moment.
As well as, she hasn't got a GitHub account. Her name can be found in the original code.

Plans:

I want to improve the code to improve my programming skills. Additionally, I want to add a Single Player Mode.
At the moment only a Multiplayer Mode is available.
